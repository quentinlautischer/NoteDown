*A testing plan, and the test suites implementing it (testing harnesses, scripts, cases) that demonstrates conformance to the functional requirements stated in the SRS, and verifies the correctness of the implementation. This implies both white-box and black-box testing; the required analyses should be a part of the test plan. The test plan itself, and all test suites, should be under version control just as the source code is.*

# Testing plan

Run all tests: `npm run test`

## Test suites

***

### Parser tests

#### Execute suite

    cd test/parser_tests
    npm test
    ^This is probably wrong, just an example

#### Functional requirements tested

TODO

#### Purpose & analysis (white-box/black-box, etc)

TODO

***

repeat for all suites
